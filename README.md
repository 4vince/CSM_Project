# Bisection Method Calculator

A Python application that implements the Bisection Method for finding roots of polynomials. This project was developed as a Final Term Project for Numerical Methods.

## Project Overview

This application provides both command-line and web-based interfaces to find roots of polynomials using the Bisection Method, one of the most fundamental numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations.

## Features

- **Dual Interfaces**: Web GUI and Command Line Interface
- **Polynomial Input**: Support for polynomials up to degree 20 with integer coefficients
- **Robust Validation**: Input validation including bound checking and tolerance validation
- **Visualization**: Graphical plot of the function and found root
- **Iterative Display**: Iteration table showing convergence progress
- **Error Handling**:  Messages and user guidance
